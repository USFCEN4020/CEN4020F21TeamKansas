This is the story of Guy Fieri from Flavor Town
Guy had to move out of Flavor Town, losing all respect in the culinary world and everything he owned,
his only choice was to go back to college!
He majored in Computer Science and was looking for oppurtunities in the field but he had no experience.
He was not able to successfully learn the necessary skills to pass coding exams and recruitment questions :(
However, his good friend Bobby Flay introduced him to InCollege! This helped Guy learn essential skills and connect with people
even though he did not have enough experience. This led to Guy finding a job posting 
that Bobby's company posted and he applied, getting the job and earning Bobby a refferal bonus.
The job was located in Flavor Town and Guy was ecstatic to move back.
